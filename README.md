NONOGRAM GAME  

  A simple C++ program to play nonogram puzzles
  
This is a basic implementation of the nomogram game that you can play on 5 different difficulty levels. The only thing you need is to first create your profile-username and password and then try to solve all 5 levels of the game.

           Functionality:
            -maintaining player profiles
            -reading a matrix from a file
            -solve the matrix by entering coordinates for a filled or empty field

        HOW TO PLAY?
    - After you create your profile, the program will load the matrix, 
      which you will have to guess which position is full and which is empty. 
      But you should know that you have a certain number of wrong answers. 
      If you exceed this number you lose the game.
I wish you good luck and have fun with my version of the Nonograms game!
